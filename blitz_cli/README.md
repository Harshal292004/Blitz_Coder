## Overview
Blitzcode CLI is a powerful, AI-driven command-line tool that helps you scaffold, generate, inspect, and manage code projects at terminal speed. It leverages advanced language models to automate repetitive coding tasks, provide code explanations, refactor code, and much moreâ€”all from your terminal.

## Features
- **AI-powered project scaffolding** for popular frameworks (FastAPI, Spring Boot, Next.js, etc.)
- **Code generation** for files, modules, and entire architectures
- **Interactive agent loop** with model selection (Qwen, Gemini, Llama, etc.)
- **File inspection, extraction, and search**
- **Run and debug Python and Node.js servers**
- **Code refactoring and explanation**
- **Colorized CLI help and output**
- **.agentignore support** to protect sensitive files
